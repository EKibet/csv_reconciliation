User Stories:

1. **As a user, I want to provide two CSV files (source and target) to the tool so that I can initiate the reconciliation process.**

2. **As a user, I want the tool to identify records that are present in the source but missing in the target, and vice versa, so that I can quickly understand the discrepancies.**

3. **As a user, I want the tool to compare each field for records that exist in both files, highlighting discrepancies, to ensure data consistency.**

4. **As a user, I want the tool to handle potential data transformation issues (e.g., date formats, case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces) during reconciliation to prevent false discrepancies.**

5. **As a user, I want the tool to produce a reconciliation report in an easily readable format (CSV, HTML, etc.) that includes sections for records missing in the target, records missing in the source, and records with field discrepancies.**

6. **As a user, I want to have the option to configure which columns to compare during reconciliation, in case some columns should be ignored.**

7. **As a user, I want the tool to implement fuzzy matching for non-identical but similar records to enhance the accuracy of reconciliation.**

8. **As a user, I want the tool to have a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy file selection and visualization of reconciliation results to streamline the process.**

9. **As a user, I want the tool to handle millions of rows efficiently, ensuring a scalable solution for large datasets.**

10. **As a user, I want the tool to provide clear and meaningful error messages in case of potential issues such as file not found, invalid CSV format, etc., so that I can address them appropriately.**

11. **As a user, I want the tool to be implemented in Python as the backend language, ensuring compatibility with our existing technology stack.**

12. **As a user, I want the CLI tool (csv_reconciler) to provide a summary after reconciliation, including the number of records missing in the target, records missing in the source, and records with field discrepancies.**

13. **As a user, I want the CLI tool to save the reconciliation report to a specified path so that I can easily access and review the results.**

14. **As a user, I appreciate a well-organized, commented, and tested solution to ensure code quality.**

15. **As a user, I appreciate documentation or instructions on how to run the tool, providing clarity on the tool's functionality and usage.**

16. **As a user, I acknowledge the expected time for completing the challenge is 3-5 hours but appreciate flexibility to use as much or as little time as needed to deliver a quality solution.**

17. **As a user interviewing for a Senior Software Engineer or Tech Lead role, I acknowledge that additional features, insights, or suggestions related to the product will be highly appreciated and may be required.**

18. **As a user, I acknowledge that implementing CI/CD is a bonus, though not required, and any effort in this direction will be appreciated.**
