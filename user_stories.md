# CSV Reconciliation Tool

A Python tool to reconcile records between two CSV files, comparing each field for discrepancies.

## Features

- [x] Accepts two CSV files as input.
- [x] Identifies records that are present in the source but missing in the target (and vice versa).
- [x] Compares each field for records that exist in both files, highlighting discrepancies.
- [x] Handles potential data transformation issues (e.g., date formats, case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces).
- [x] Produces a reconciliation report with sections for missing records and field discrepancies.
- [x] Implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy file selection and result visualization.
- [ ] Allows the user to configure which columns to compare, in case some columns should be ignored.
- [ ] Implements fuzzy matching for non-identical but similar records.
- [x] Provides documentation or instructions on how to run the tool.
- [ ] Scales over millions of rows.

```bash
$ python csv_reconciler.py -s source.csv -t target.csv -o reconciliation_report.csv
