# Reconciliation Toolkit

Welcome to the Reconciliation Toolkit, a versatile toolset for reconciling CSV files with ease. This toolkit provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to streamline the reconciliation process.

## Overview

The Reconciliation Toolkit offers two main components:

1. **Reconciliation CLI:**
   - For detailed instructions on using the CLI, please refer to the [CLI README](reconciliation-cli/README.md).
   - The CLI allows you to reconcile CSV files through a command-line interface, providing a summary of discrepancies and saving a reconciliation report.

2. **Reconciliation GUI:**
   - For the GUI tool, check out the [GUI README](gui-tool/README.md).
   - The GUI simplifies the reconciliation process with a user-friendly interface, allowing you to select source and target CSV files, run reconciliation, and view results visually.

## Demo

Here's a brief demonstration of how the Reconciliation Toolkit works:

## Future Implementations

We are continuously working to enhance the Reconciliation Toolkit. Future improvements may include:

- Allow users to configure which columns to compare, in case some columns should be ignored.
- Integration with cloud storage services.
- Performance optimizations for large datasets through the use of Dask for parallel processing.


## Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions in the respective README files for the CLI and GUI components.
